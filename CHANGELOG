v0.3.1
  * rdoc documentation updates

v0.3.0
  * bumped the minor number because this release is not backwards compatible. 
  * stub now works more intuitively. Suppose you had a :book resource, and you wanted to stub 
    20 "sci-fi" books where both the title and author were different for every resource .
      Dupe.stub 20, :books, :like => {:genre => "sci-fi", :title => proc {|n| "title-#{n}"}, :author => proc {|n| "author-#{n}"}}

v0.2.3
  * ruby 1.8.6 compat fix (Symbol doesn't support upcase)

v0.2.2
  * patched ActiveResource::Connection.get/delete/put/post/head to log appropriate request headers in the request log.  

v0.2.1
  * configuration options now behave diffently if that option name is singular v. plural
    for example, 
      Dupe.configuration :resource do |config|
        config.record_identifiers :id
      end
    would result in the Dupe.factories[:resource].configuration.config[:record_identifiers] being set to [:id] (since 
    "record identifiers" is plural, it assumes you're specifying an array of values). 

    however, 
      Dupe.configuration do |global_config|
        global_config.debug true
      end
    sets Dupe.global_configuration.config[:debug] = true (it assumes that since "debug" is singular, that configuration can
    only have one value, so it doesn't bother putting it in an array). 

    mostly, you'll never really need to know how Dupe.configuration is storing the configuration internally. 

v0.2.0

  * new global configuration option "debug". will output all request attempts / mocked responses that occurred
    during the course of a scenario. consult the api documentation (moonmaster9000.github.com/dupe/api) for 
    more information.

v0.1.2 
  
  * initial github publish. includes all the basic api: configure (factory), create, stub, define, define_mocks, find.
