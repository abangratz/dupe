Feature: mocking resources
  As a developer
  I want to mock service responses
  So that I can cuke my application without worrying about whether or not I can connect to the service

Scenario: mocking simple, unassociated resources
  Given I have no resource definitions
  When I create an empty "book"
  Then Dupe should mock the response to "/books.xml" with 
  """
  [{"id"=>1}]
  """
  And Dupe should mock the response to "/books/1.xml" with 
  """
  {"id"=>1}
  """

Scenario: mocking complex resources with associations
  Given I have an author resource
  And a book that has one author
  When I create an author named "Arthur C. Clarke"
  And I create a book titled "2001: A Space Odyssey" written by "Arthur C. Clarke"
  Then Dupe should mock the response to "/books.xml" with 
  """
  [{"id"=>1, "title" => "2001: A Space Odyssey", "author" => {"id" => 1, "name" => "Arthur C. Clarke"}}]
  """
  And Dupe should mock the response to "/books/1.xml" with 
  """
  {"id"=>1, "title" => "2001: A Space Odyssey", "author" => {"id" => 1, "name" => "Arthur C. Clarke"}}
  """
  And Dupe should mock the response to "/authors.xml" with
  """
  [{"id" => 1, "name" => "Arthur C. Clarke"}]
  """
  And Dupe should mock the response to "/authors/1.xml" with 
  """
  {"id" => 1, "name" => "Arthur C. Clarke"}
  """

Scenario: stubbing simple resources
  When I stub 5 books starting with the title "stubby 1"
  Then Dupe should mock the response to "/books.xml" with 
  """
  [
    {"id" => 1, "title" => "stubby 1"},
    {"id" => 2, "title" => "stubby 2"},
    {"id" => 3, "title" => "stubby 3"},
    {"id" => 4, "title" => "stubby 4"},
    {"id" => 5, "title" => "stubby 5"}
  ]
  """
  When I stub 5 more books starting with the title "stubsville 9000"
  Then Dupe should mock the response to "/books.xml" with 
  """
  [
    {"id" => 1, "title" => "stubby 1"},
    {"id" => 2, "title" => "stubby 2"},
    {"id" => 3, "title" => "stubby 3"},
    {"id" => 4, "title" => "stubby 4"},
    {"id" => 5, "title" => "stubby 5"},
    {"id" => 6, "title" => "stubsville 9000"},
    {"id" => 7, "title" => "stubsville 9001"},
    {"id" => 8, "title" => "stubsville 9002"},
    {"id" => 9, "title" => "stubsville 9003"},
    {"id" => 10, "title" => "stubsville 9004"}
  ]
  """

Scenario: stubbing complex resources
  Given I have an author resource
  And a book that has one author
  When I create an author named "stubmeister"
  And  I stub 5 books starting with the title "stubby 1" written by "stubmeister"
  Then Dupe should mock the response to "/books.xml" with 
  """
  [
    {"id" => 1, "title" => "stubby 1", "author" => {"id" => 1, "name" => "stubmeister"}},
