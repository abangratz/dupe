= Dupe 

There are lots of great tools out there to ease the burden of prototyping ActiveRecord objects while cuking your application (e.g., thoughtbot's "Factory Girl"[http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/factory_girl]).
But what about prototyping ActiveResource records? That's where Dupe steps in.  

== Installation

  # gem install moonmaster9000-dupe

== Example
Let's suppose your cuking a book search application for a library that consumes a RESTFUL book datastore service via ActiveResource.
You might start by writing the following feature in <em>RAILS_ROOT/features/library/find_book.feature</em>:

  Feature: find a book
    As a reader
    I want to search for books
    so that I can check them out and read them. 

  Scenario: search by author
    Given an author "Arthur C. Clarke"
    And a book "2001: A Space Odyssey" by "Arthur C. Clarke"
    When I search for "Arthur C. Clarke"
    I should see "2001: A Space Odyssey"

To get this to pass, you might first create ActiveResource[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveResource/Base.html] models for Books and Authors that connect to the Library service:

  class Book < ActiveResource::Base
    self.site = 'http://bookservice.domain'
  end

  class Author < ActiveResource::Base
    self.site = 'http://bookservice.domain'
  end

Then you might create the following resource definition via Dupe.define (put it in a file with a .rb extension and place it in RAILS_ROOT/features/support/):
  
  Dupe.define :book do |book|
    book.author do |author_name|
      Dupe.find(:author) {|a| a.name == author_name}
    end
  end

and the following cucumber step definitions (utilizing Dupe.create):
  
  Given /^an author "([^\"]*)"$/ do |author|
    Dupe.create :author, :name => author
  end

  Given /^a book "([^\"]*)" by "([^\"]*)"$/ do |book, author|
    Dupe.create :book, :title => book, :author => author 
  end

Dupe.create will in turn mock two service responses for each resource. For example,
for the Book resource, it will mock:

  # Book.find(:all) --> GET /books.xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <books type="array">
    <book>
      <id type="integer">1</id>
      <title>2001: A Space Odyssey</title>
      <author>
        <id type="integer">1</id>
        <name>Arthur C. Clarke</name>
      </author>
    </book>
  </books>

  # Book.find(1) --> GET /books/1.xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <book>
    <id type="integer">1</id>
    <title>2001: A Space Odyssey</title>
    <author>
      <id type="integer">1</id>
      <name>Arthur C. Clarke</name>
    </author>
  </book>
